Can you supply a sample of code (or a link towards) 
which you would consider production ready, elegant and high quality.

I would say that I consider that every thing that is coming from Apache is top notch.
But even with them, there is always a possibility of bugs.
If you need a sample/link, I would say that the guys that are working on Atmosphere project are doing pretty clean code :
(for example)
https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-extensions/tree/master/gwt/modules/atmosphere-gwt-js/src/main/java/org/atmosphere/gwt/js
